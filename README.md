## dbx-proxy

`dbx-proxy` is a lightweight **HAProxy-based load balancer** that enables **private network connectivity** from **Databricks Serverless** compute to **resources in your own VPC/VNet** (for example: databases, applications, etc).

### What problem it solves

Many enterprise resources live in private networks and are not reachable from serverless compute by default. `dbx-proxy` provides a controlled entry point for [private connectivity to resources in your VPC/Vnet](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/security/network/serverless-network-security/pl-to-internal-network).

### What you get

- **Forwarding of L4 & L7 network traffic** based on your configuration
  - L4 (TCP) forwarding
  - L7 (HTTP) forwarding with **SNI-based routing**
- **Terraform module** ready to use (currently **AWS only**)

### Deployment (Terraform) / How to use

`dbx-proxy` essentially provides Steps 1 and 2 when following the official Databricks documentation for private connectivity to resources in your own networks:
- [(AWS) Configure private connectivity to resources in your VPC](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/security/network/serverless-network-security/pl-to-internal-network)


Include the module in your Terraform stack:
```hcl
module "dbx_proxy" {

  source = "github.com/dnks0/dbx-proxy//terraform/aws?ref=v0.1.0"

  # aws config
  region    = "eu-central-1"
  tags      = {}
  ...

  # dbx-proxy config
  dbx_proxy_image_version = "0.1.0"
  dbx_proxy_health_port   = 8080

  # Example: forward TCP/443 to a private target in your VPC
  dbx_proxy_listener = [
    {
      name  = "http-443"
      mode  = "http"
      port  = 443
      routes = [
        {
          name    = "example"
          domains = ["example.internal"]
          destinations = [
            { name = "example-server-1", host = "10.0.1.10", port = 443 },
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

More details about the Terraform module and configurations can be found [here](terraform/README.md).

You will still need to configure the Databricks-side objects like NCC, private endpoint rules and accept the connection on your endpoint-service.

### Troubleshooting

To validate that the proxy is up and reachable,run the following from a serverless notebook:

```bash
%sh

curl -sS -w '\nHTTP %{http_code}\n' http://<ncc-endpoint-rule-domain>:8080/status
```
